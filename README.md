# TICKETINO IFrame Configurator

This is a simple little tool to configure custom styles for the TICKETINO IFrame to embed ticket selection on your own website. It lets you set the different colors / styles and preview them on the same page. After you are done, you can easily copy the code for the IFrame you just created.
